# AI connections: ACP, BYOK and local models

## Behavior

Settings → AI offers ACP, BYOK and Local Models. Existing configuration migrates to ACP without changing its provider or project. Settings changes apply to the next conversation; an active chat and its draft retain their connection. AI Chat still uses Return to send, Shift-Return for a newline, the existing Markdown renderer, explicit cancellation and full-panel conversation UI.

ACP retains the existing CLI login, optional working folder and agent permission flow. BYOK supports OpenAI Responses streaming, Anthropic Messages streaming and custom OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoints. Local connections use the compatible protocol on loopback. API chat is text-only; it does not inherit ACP's terminal/filesystem tools. The configured server receives the current prompt and previously completed turns. OpenAI requests use `store: false`; this is not a claim about every provider's retention policy.

API keys are stored in device-local Keychain generic-password entries keyed by provider and endpoint, never in config JSON or backups. Save Key and Remove Key report failures without replacing a working key on an update failure. Key bytes pass only to the selected helper connection/request. Custom endpoints require HTTPS, except explicit loopback HTTP. Redirects are refused, preventing keys/prompts from following redirects to another origin. No provider error bodies or source/response text are logged by Volant.

The separate `VolantAIHost` XPC service has App Sandbox plus outbound networking. The main app and WASM helper gain no network entitlement. Sessions are ephemeral, with no cookies, URL cache, background downloads or credential storage. Ending the connection cancels in-flight work. API snapshots stop polling once the conversation is ready; typing and launcher startup do not start network requests.

## Local detection

Opening Local Models in Settings probes the OpenAI-compatible model-list endpoints on loopback ports 11434 (Ollama convention), 1234 (LM Studio convention), and 8000 (generic local API). These are candidate server locations, not proof of a particular installed application. The list comes from the server; it does not mean every returned model is currently loaded or supports chat. Volant does not scan model files, launch services, download models, or start inference during detection. Custom loopback ports/base paths and optional local authentication are supported through manual fields and Test Connection.

Use selects a discovered server and model. Test Connection lists models on the selected endpoint; it verifies discovery/authentication, not a successful inference request. Unavailable, no-model and key-required servers remain explicit. Closing Settings, switching connection type, editing an endpoint or rescanning rejects late discovery responses. Detection does not enable or select a connection automatically.

## Resource and failure bounds

One turn at a time, at most 100 visible messages, 64 KiB per new prompt, 256 KiB transcript/history budget, 2 MiB stream wire budget, 64 KiB SSE line/event limit and a 180-second resource timeout. Model lists are capped at 1 MiB/1,000 entries. Stop cancels the turn and invalidates its generation; partial failed/cancelled responses stay visible but are excluded from future request history. Truncated streams are reported, never treated as complete. No automatic prompt retries or cloud fallback from Local Models.

## Verification and limitations

`AIHTTPTests` covers endpoint/credential isolation, provider request shapes, SSE completion/Unicode/error bounds, migration and stale discovery. `tools/check-ai-http.sh` runs the production transport/conversation against a fictional loopback server: model listing, streaming, concurrent rejection, cancellation, stale chunks, redirects, truncation and generic authentication errors. It runs through `Scripts/test.sh` in native CI. ACP regression checks remain required.

`tools/check-ai-xpc.sh` separately exercises the exported Developer ID helper through the production chat model and Settings discovery against that loopback fixture. It also checks a sandboxed client and an isolated fictional Keychain entry through save/read/replace/remove. It requires `VOLANT_AI_APP` and signing credentials, does not launch owner UI, and is not live provider authentication or inference evidence. Native Tart fixtures cover the affected Settings modes, local available/unavailable states, and chat in light/dark appearances without real credentials or servers.

Before claiming installed provider readiness, verify Keychain save/read/remove and a minimal user-authorized prompt through the signed installed app for each cloud provider and an actual local server. No live account, purchased API request, model download or installed-app restart is implied by fixture success. API key availability, model access, provider-specific context limits, reasoning/tool output, attachments and full compatible-server parity remain separate checks/features. Anthropic model pagination and richer local model state are follow-ups; manual model IDs are supported.

## Quality decision

Keep the API transport separate from ACP so provider tools and CLI credentials cannot leak into BYOK/local requests. Preserve connection ownership across Settings edits, use explicit cancellation and validate the final streamed completion marker. Fake discovery/credentials are injectable in native fixtures; opening a preview must not contact owner servers or Keychain. Build, rendered UI, real HTTP, signed XPC and live provider evidence are distinct.

Fixture lessons: CI may start Python more slowly than a developer machine; use the configured test interpreter, a bounded 30-second readiness wait, and preserve startup diagnostics. Chat rendering fixtures need a real hosting window and semantic background before inspecting light/dark output.

## Apple Intelligence — September 21, 2026

A fourth connection kind, `apple`, runs Apple's on-device model through FoundationModels. It is the
only kind that needs no endpoint, no API key, no credential in the Keychain and no helper process:
the conversation runs inside the sandboxed app itself and never reaches the network.

Verified in a signed bundle carrying Volant's own entitlements, so App Sandbox is not in the way:
the model reported `available` and a streamed prompt returned its answer. That check matters because
the sandbox does block other system services; it was measured rather than assumed.

### Supporting macOS 15 and macOS 26 from one build

FoundationModels is macOS 26 and later while Volant's deployment target is macOS 15. Every entry
point is behind `#if canImport(FoundationModels)` and `#available(macOS 26.0, *)`, and the framework
weak-links, so an older Mac runs the same binary with the option present but unavailable.

`AppleFoundationModel.Availability` is the only thing the rest of the app asks. It answers `ready`
or `unavailable` with a sentence the owner can act on: the Mac is ineligible, Apple Intelligence is
switched off in System Settings, the model is still downloading, or the system is older than macOS
26. Settings shows that sentence rather than leaving a disabled button unexplained, and availability
is rechecked when a conversation starts, because it can be switched off between the two.

### Streaming is cumulative, not incremental

`LanguageModelSession.streamResponse` yields the complete text so far on each chunk, and it repeats
values and may rewrite them. Measured directly: a five-word reply arrived as seven chunks of
lengths 5, 9, 14, 20, 21, 21, 21. The first implementation here treated those as deltas, which would
have produced badly duplicated text in the transcript.

The conversation API therefore delivers a `snapshot` and the chat model replaces its assistant
message instead of appending. Unchanged snapshots are dropped rather than republished. This is the
opposite of the HTTP path, where `AIStreamDecoder` genuinely emits deltas.

### Not covered

Live use through the installed signed app, and behavior on a Mac where Apple Intelligence is off or
ineligible — both availability branches are reasoned from the framework's own enum rather than
observed. There is no model picker: the kind uses `SystemLanguageModel.default`.

## On-device dictation — September 21, 2026

`talk` in the launcher, or a hotkey of its own, records through Apple's `SpeechAnalyzer` and copies
the transcript to the clipboard. Audio never leaves the Mac and nothing is written to disk.

### What it costs, measured before it was written

Four questions were answered with signed probes carrying Volant's own entitlements, launched
through LaunchServices so nothing was inherited from a terminal.

- **Transcription in App Sandbox: free.** `SpeechTranscriber.isAvailable` is true, 45 locales are
  supported, and the system already had the assets installed, so there is no download and no
  entitlement. A generated sample transcribed accurately.
- **Microphone capture: one entitlement.** `com.apple.security.device.audio-input` plus
  `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` and the ordinary microphone prompt. Verified by checking sample
  amplitudes rather than trusting `engine.start`, which returns OK *without* the entitlement while
  capturing digital silence — the same false positive `CGEvent.tapCreate` gives.
- **Hold-to-talk: free.** Carbon delivers `kEventHotKeyReleased` for a registered combination.
  Measured sandboxed with a real keypress: two presses, two releases, three-second and two-second
  holds. No Input Monitoring and no Accessibility.
- **Auto-insert into the focused app: not done.** Both routes, synthesising Command-V and writing
  through `AXUIElement`, need the Accessibility grant Volant refuses and `docs/competitors.md`
  cites as a differentiator. The transcript is copied instead and the paste stays the owner's
  keystroke.

### Behavior

`talk` toggles: Return starts listening, Return stops and copies. The dedicated hotkey does both
shapes — hold it for longer than 0.4 s and releasing stops, tap it and it keeps listening until the
next tap. The panel shows a live microphone indicator and the text heard so far, so dictation is
never running invisibly.

Availability is rechecked at start, because microphone permission can be revoked between uses. On
macOS 15 the command is present and reports that it needs macOS 26, the same pattern Apple
Intelligence uses.

### The availability gate is not the same as Apple Intelligence's

`canImport(FoundationModels)` works as a gate because that framework is absent from the macOS 15
SDK entirely. `Speech` is not: it has existed since macOS 10.15, so `canImport(Speech)` is true on
the older SDK while `SpeechAnalyzer`, `SpeechTranscriber` and `AnalyzerInput` are missing from it.
Gating on `canImport(Speech)` alone compiled here and failed on CI's macOS 15 runner with three
"cannot find type in scope" errors.

The gate is therefore `canImport(Speech) && canImport(FoundationModels)`, where the second
condition stands in for "built against an SDK new enough to see these symbols". Anything using a
macOS 26 API from a framework that also exists on macOS 15 needs the same treatment, and the
compiled-out branch should be type-checked deliberately rather than assumed.

### Not covered

Live dictation through the signed installed app, the accuracy of long transcripts, locale
selection on a Mac whose language the engine does not support, and behaviour when a microphone is
removed mid-session. The native fixtures do not render the dictation indicator.
