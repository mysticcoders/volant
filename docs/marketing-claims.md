# Marketing claims — October 7, 2026 (0.2.0)

## Promise and release boundary

Keep work moving without leaving your flow: apps, answers, notes, and agents within reach. Keep the established “Your Mac. Your agents. One shortcut away.” headline and graphite/coral site system.

The public artifact is Volant 0.2.0, build 8, from `d9b6dbc` (October 7, 2026). The rows below that were Coming next for 0.1.5 shipped in this build, verified against the notarized DMG: version, both architectures, stapled signature, iCloud key-value and loginwindow entitlements, and the embedded Developer ID profile. Advance claims only after verifying the actual distributed artifact; merging a website PR does not distribute a new app or publish the website.

| Story | In 0.2.0 | Evidence and limits | Website treatment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Apps, learned ranking, aliases, shortcuts, files, contacts, calendar | Yes | Existing native fixtures; hardware shortcut delivery is separate | Everyday launcher story |
| Markdown notes, encrypted clipboard, snippets, Raycast data import | Yes | Persistence and native fixture coverage; supported import types only | Useful things within reach |

| API/local models | Yes | HTTP and signed-helper fixtures; live authenticated provider/local inference remains separate | Implemented options, no blanket readiness claim |

## Privacy language

No Volant account or telemetry. Notes and encrypted clipboard history remain local. Submitted AI prompts and selected context reach the chosen provider/server. Keys stay in Keychain. Updates, HTTP AI and rates use separate helpers; opt-in iCloud uses Apple's system service. Avoid blanket “everything stays on your Mac,” “entirely offline,” or “zero dependencies” claims.

## Imagery

Existing hero and Notes assets are native fixtures. Added calculator, waiting-question, and unsent attachment-draft images come from the production SwiftUI views compiled with the release-optimized asset catalog, in a headless macOS 27 Tart guest. All stores, project names, session identifiers, note text, and questions are fictional. Agent input and network/provider connections are injected or absent. Light/dark captures are inspected separately. Render success is not a live provider, remote-machine, hardware, or performance test.

## Next concrete gaps

1. Done October 7, 2026: published the 0.2.0 website, verified DMG delivery, activated the signed build-8 appcast, and the owner completed 0.1.5 → 0.2.0 Sparkle upgrades on two Macs.
2. Complete compatible remote Herdr, real-provider attachment, and installed Apple/model checks under their own authorized test scope.
3. Refresh the original hero/Notes imagery in a future cohesive capture pass; do not reconstruct native UI in HTML.
