        Volume, audio routes, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi, all through public APIs
        inside the existing sandbox. No new entitlement, no helper, and no
        Accessibility grant.
      </p>

      <h2>Volume</h2>
      <p>
        Type <code>volume</code> or <code>vol</code> to see the volume commands
        and your current default output.
      </p>
      <div className="docs-table-scroll">
        <table className="docs-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Command</th>
              <th>Effect</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td><code>volume up</code> / <code>volume down</code></td>
              <td>Adjusts by five percentage points.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>volume 40</code> or <code>volume 40%</code></td>
              <td>Sets an exact level.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>mute</code> / <code>unmute</code></td>
              <td>Explicit actions, not a toggle.</td>

      <p>
        Return applies the selected action and keeps the launcher open, so you
        can adjust repeatedly. An invalid percentage never produces an
        actionable row.
      </p>
      <p>
        Volume changes keep your existing mute state, and channels scale
        together to preserve balance. The level shown is read back from the
        hardware; it refreshes on a query or an action, not continuously while
        another app changes it. Outputs that do not support software volume —
        common on digital connections — are labeled as such and explained rather
        than silently failing.
      </p>
      <div className="docs-note">
        <p>
          <code>vol</code>, <code>volume</code>, <code>mute</code>, and{' '}
          <code>unmute</code> are reserved ahead of your aliases and quicklinks,
          so a Raycast import will tell you if it had to skip one of those
          names.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Audio devices</h2>
      <p>
        <code>audio</code>, <code>output</code>, and <code>input</code> list
        eligible audio routes, and you can filter by name — <code>output
        airpods</code> or <code>audio input mac</code>. Your current input and
        output are marked independently, and switching one direction never
        changes the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Switching re-resolves the device&rsquo;s stable identifier before
        acting, so a recycled system device ID cannot send audio somewhere
        unexpected. This does not connect disconnected Bluetooth headphones, and
        no recording ever happens.
      </p>

      <h2>Bluetooth</h2>
      <p>
        <code>bluetooth</code> or <code>bt</code> lists connected paired
        devices. This is not a complete inventory of every nearby or unpaired
        peripheral. Selecting a device opens Bluetooth Settings to manage it —
        Volant does not connect or disconnect devices itself.
      </p>

      <h2>Wi-Fi</h2>
      <p>
        <code>wifi</code> scans visible networks and filters by name. Your
        current network is marked, and duplicate access points sharing an SSID
        and security type collapse to the strongest signal. Scan results live
        only in memory, with a fifteen-second freshness window.
      </p>
      <p>
        Open and WPA/WPA2/WPA3 Personal networks can be joined directly, using a
        native secure field inside the launcher.{' '}
        <strong>Use Saved Password</strong> explicitly requests that
        SSID&rsquo;s password from your Keychain. Hidden and enterprise networks
        hand off to System Settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Passwords are never stored in Volant&rsquo;s configuration, history, or
        logs, and a password you type manually is not silently saved to the
        Keychain.
      </p>

      <h2>Permissions</h2>
      <p>
        Bluetooth uses its own sandbox entitlement and system consent. Reading
        Wi-Fi network <em>names</em> requires Location authorization on macOS —
        Volant requests that authorization but never requests coordinates and
        never starts location updates. Both are asked for on first use, and
        denying either produces guidance plus a System Settings action rather
        than a broken screen.
