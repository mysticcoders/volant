      <h2>The main app has no network access</h2>
      <p>
        The main binary ships with <strong>no network entitlement</strong>, so
        it cannot phone home even in principle. Two deliberate exceptions live
        outside it:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Updates</strong> run through Sparkle&rsquo;s own separate
          helper process.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Agent connections</strong> run through a separate local
          helper. See <a href="/docs/agents">Agents</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Opening a link hands it to another app. Running an Apple Shortcut hands
        execution to Shortcuts, whose workflows use their own permissions.

          Be aware that Apple&rsquo;s Calendar grant is a full-access grant at
          the OS level. Volant only reads — but that restraint is the
          app&rsquo;s, not the operating system&rsquo;s.
        </p>

      <h2>Permissions Volant does not ask for</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>No Accessibility grant. No Input Monitoring grant.</strong>{' '}
        Global hotkeys use Carbon&rsquo;s hotkey registration, which needs no
        permission at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is also why version 0.1 copies results to the clipboard instead of
        pasting them: no keystroke is ever synthesized. It is the reason
        paste-in-place, window management, and system-wide text expansion are
        absent — each would require that grant, and they were ruled out rather
        than quietly added.
      </p>

      <h2>Your data at rest</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Clipboard history</strong> is AES-GCM encrypted with a 256-bit
          Keychain key scoped to this device while unlocked, stored in SQLite
          with <code>secure_delete</code>, and excluded from Time Machine.
          Password-manager copies are skipped unconditionally.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Notes</strong> are ordinary <code>.md</code> files you can
          open in any editor.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Configuration</strong> is a portable text file you can read,
          diff, and back up.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Learned ranking</strong> lives in a local SQLite file. Nothing
          about it leaves the machine.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Code you can check</h2>
      <p>
        Volant is MIT licensed and its source is public. It has zero third-party
        dependencies — AppKit, SwiftUI, Carbon, CryptoKit, SQLite3, and
        Security.
      </p>
      <p>
        Release builds are Developer ID signed, hardened, notarized, and
        stapled. The release script refuses to package an archive that carries
        debugger access, carries a network entitlement, or lacks a Developer ID
        signature — so a build that violated the posture above could not ship
        silently.
