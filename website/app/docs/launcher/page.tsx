      <h1>The launcher</h1>
      <p className="docs-lede">
        One field that searches your Mac and answers small questions. It opens
        ready to type, and dismisses when it loses focus — except while a system
        permission prompt is up.
      </p>

      <h2>Launching apps</h2>
      <p>
        Type to fuzzy-search your applications and press Return to launch. If
        the app is already running, its per-app hotkey brings it forward and
        pressing again hides it.
      </p>

      <h3>Ranking that learns</h3>
      <p>
        Every choice is recorded locally, along with the exact query that led to
        it. A use adds a point to a score with a seven-day half-life, so what
        you pick daily outranks an old binge. Among matched apps that score acts
        as a bonus, and the app you last chose for the <em>exact</em> query you
        typed is pinned first — which is why <code>sa</code> learns Safari after
        a single pick.
      </p>
      <p>
        On an empty query you get your most-chosen apps, filled out with
        Spotlight&rsquo;s last-used dates. None of this leaves the machine.
      </p>

      <h2>What a search returns</h2>
      <p>
        Results merge in a fixed order: math and unit results first, then apps,
        then up to three contacts and five files once the query is long enough
        to be worth it.
      </p>

      <h3>Prefixes force one source</h3>
      <div className="docs-table-scroll">
        <table className="docs-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Prefix</th>
              <th>Searches</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td><code>/</code></td>
              <td>Files only.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>@</code></td>
              <td>Contacts only. Contacts results merge into ordinary searches once access has been granted here at least once.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>cal</code> or <code>today</code></td>

            <tr>

              <td>Recent notes. <code>note term</code> searches note contents and offers to create one.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>snip</code></td>
              <td>Snippets. You can also just type a snippet&rsquo;s keyword.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>:</code></td>
              <td>Emoji, searching 1,765 names from the bundled Unicode database.</td>

            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <h2>Calculating and converting</h2>
      <p>
        Type an expression such as <code>2^10 / 3</code> or{' '}
        <code>sqrt(2)*pi</code> and the result appears; Return copies it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conversions work the same way: <code>5 km in mi</code>,{' '}
        <code>72f to c</code>, <code>1 gib in mb</code>. These run entirely
        offline through Foundation&rsquo;s measurement units. There is no
        currency conversion, because that would need a network source.
      </p>

      <h2>Today&rsquo;s agenda</h2>
      <p>
        <code>cal</code> shows Today and Tomorrow. Select a meeting and press
        Return to join from its meeting link, or open it in Calendar.
      </p>

      <h2>Aliases and quicklinks</h2>
      <p>
        An <strong>alias</strong> maps a word to an app name and ranks that app
        first — <code>gh</code> for GitHub Desktop, say.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <strong>quicklink</strong> is a named URL with an optional{' '}
        <code>{'{query}'}</code> slot, so <code>google volant launcher</code>{' '}
        opens the search. Quicklinks accept http, https, mailto, and validated{' '}
        <code>shortcuts://run-shortcut</code> URLs — see{' '}
        <a href="/docs/shortcuts">Apple Shortcuts</a>. Both live in{' '}
        <a href="/docs/configuration">config.json</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>The footer tells you the action</h2>
      <p>
        The footer names the Return action for whichever row is selected.
        Command-Return runs the secondary action instead — revealing a file in
        Finder, or copying a contact&rsquo;s phone number.
      </p>

      <h2>Moving the window</h2>
      <p>
        Drag the wing in the search header to move Volant. The position is saved
        and recovered into a visible display when your screen arrangement
        changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Snap guides align the launcher to the usable screen center and edges,
        with a 20-point inset and a 12-point capture distance, each axis
        resolving independently against the display holding the pointer. Hold
        Option during a drag to bypass both snapping and the guides.
      </p>

      <h2>Appearance</h2>
      <p>
        <code>appearance.scale</code> accepts 0.8 to 1.4 and{' '}
        <code>appearance.opacity</code> accepts 0.5 to 1.0 in your
        configuration.
      </p>
